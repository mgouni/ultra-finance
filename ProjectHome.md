# Welcome #

Ultra-finance is a pure Python library & utility for real time stock data collection, analyzing and backtesting.

**Code has been moved to** https://github.com/panpanpandas/ultrafinance


# First Build #
  * First build is available at: http://code.google.com/p/ultra-finance/downloads/list
  * Installation instruction can be found at: http://code.google.com/p/ultra-finance/wiki/BuildProcess
  * Any questions can be posted at: http://groups.google.com/group/ultra-finance?pli=1

# Examples #
  * [stock crawler](http://code.google.com/p/ultra-finance/wiki/stockCrawler) -- save stock quotes/ticks to local disk(sqlite or hbase)


# Design #
We try to keep the structure flat. Most modules are independent and can be executed easily.

Ultra-finance consists of four components:
  * DAM(data access model): provides general API for quote/tick/financials access. There are four DAMs implemented: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, HBase and Excel. ![http://ultra-finance.googlecode.com/files/DAM.jpg](http://ultra-finance.googlecode.com/files/DAM.jpg)
  * Backtesting: validates trading strategies with historical quotes/ticks. Backtesting is functional completed now. ![http://ultra-finance.googlecode.com/files/uf_components.jpg](http://ultra-finance.googlecode.com/files/uf_components.jpg)
  * Python TA-Lib: pure python library that process financial data. This component is still in design.
  * Stock picker: Based on real data and user defined filter, this component will rank/pick the stocks.

Plan:
In near future, this project will be focus on backtesting. The first step is to do backtesting on one strategy using one stock quote data as input. The final goal to do backtesting within a single run to get results of multiple strategies with hundreds of separate rounds while each round takes multiple stocks quotes/ticks as input.

Features/effort are listed below for each run of backtesting:
| Number of Tests | Number of Stock Inputs Per Test | Number of Strategies Per Round | Data Type | Realtime | Effort | Status |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:----------|:---------|:-------|:-------|
| 1               | 1                               | 1                              | Quote     | No       | 2 full days | DONE   |
| 1               | multiple                        | 1                              | Quote     |  No      | 2 full days | DONE   |
| multiple        | multiple                        | 1                              | Quote     |  No      | 2 full days | DONE   |
| multiple        | multiple                        | multiple                       | Quote     |  No      | Unknown |
| multiple        | multiple                        | multiple                       | Quote/Tick |  Yes     | Unknown |

Wish-list:
  * UI or website or graph generating
  * real time web news and analyze(web crawler), when bad/good news comes, ultra-finance will do trading automatically
  * integrate with NumPy(data processing), PyQT(or wxpython), Pyramid(Pylons) and pandas
